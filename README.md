# Microtonal Fabric

This is a documentation project for integration of the [Mictoronal Fabric](https://github.com/SAKryukov/microtonal-fabric) development with [CodeProject publications](https://www.codeproject.com/Members/SAKryukov) on this topic.

It will be used to publish news, previews of the applications and components under development and integrate documentation and CodeProject articles.

### Original Publications

_[Musical Study with Isomorphic Computer Keyboard](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1201737/Musical-Study-with-Isomorphic-Computer-Keyboard)_, August 16, 2017<br/><small>This is the first work of the keyboard-related cycle, and it is not microtonal. However, it contains some theoretical introduction applicable to other works, which are essentially microtonal.</small>

### Experimental: Microtonal Playground

Live play: [Microtonal Playground](https://sakryukov.github.io/microtonal-fabric/code/playground/index.html)

This is a new experimental application _under development_.

It allows anyone to define one's own frequencies, place them in a simple rectangular-grid keyboard and play with ten fingers on a touchscreen, or at least with a mouse/touchpad. For the customization, the _live play_ won't be enough, it shows some demo, presently based on the [scales](https://en.xen.wiki/w/User:Aura/Aura's_Diatonic_Scales) presented by [Dawson Berry](https://en.xen.wiki/w/User:Aura). Presently, you need to download the entire product and modify the file &ldquo;user.data&rdquo;. The definition mechanism is very flexible: the frequencies can be defined as fixed values or as rational-number intervals relative to the specified base tone, the labels can be customized, automatic repetition of tones with octave transposition is available.

Later, the application will get standard controls of volume, sustain, transposition, and the Recorder. Right now, only the choice of instrument is available.

Also under development: the tonal system put forward by [Kite Giedraitis](https://en.xen.wiki/w/Kite_Giedraitis), with [his layout and generator system](https://en.xen.wiki/w/Color_notation#Interval_Names). I already make it playable, but I'm trying to design something to be _practically playable_.
